## Reporting a Vulnerability

Open an issue here on Github.

Notifications are reviewed weekly. Non-Major dependency vulnerabilities are
pushed quickly with minimal/no testing. Major dependency updates will take
longer: This project is a work of passion, and will take a back-seat to IRL
issues. If a direct vulnerability in this project is found, the same priority
expectation is applied. But, a community member is free to contribute and test
a fix if they are so inclined. I will happily review and accept PR's.
